GitHub Profile README (Intro Section)
Test Automation Engineer (SDET) with a strong software engineering background and hands-on experience in designing scalable test automation frameworks.

I work with .NET and Python to build end-to-end automation solutions and AI-assisted QA tooling. My recent projects focus on:
- Using Microsoft Semantic Kernel for LLM orchestration
- Designing AI Agents for automated test analysis and defect triage
- Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines with vector databases
- Deploying QA and AI services in Docker- and Kubernetes-based environments

I am seeking on-site or hybrid opportunities in the Netherlands and require visa sponsorship and relocation.
